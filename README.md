# Automation-of-wallpapers-using-python

This a very baisc python automation project which is used to automate the wallpapers in your computer. This Automation works on Windows only. In this project I have used the Unsplash API to get the images for the wallpaper and have stored them in a temp file so that the wallpapers we get from the api are automatically deleted after the execution of the object, hence retaining the memory. In this mini project i have used python's requests module to extract data from unsplash's live data base inform of JSON. In order to manage the os and environment  i have used ctype,platform and os module of python. For file management and memory retention i have used wget and shutil modules.. As it uses unsplash api, the api calls are limited. Hope u find this basic project interesting :-) .
